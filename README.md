# Netflix Clone

This project uses React to build a clone website of Netflix. This was created with the purpose of learning aspects of front-end development using React, as well as back-end development from making get requests to gather movie data from the TMDB API.

Hosted on Firebase, and is able to play movie trailers from YouTube by clicking on the movie/show poster.
